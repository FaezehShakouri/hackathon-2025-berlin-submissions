## Description (TL;DR)

- An open-source Reticulum-based 5G link-layer example enhanced with zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) challenge-response authentication.
- It enables privacy-preserving, cryptographically secure link establishment between clients and servers, ensuring user identities remain confidential while preventing unauthorized access.

## Problem

- Current 5G network authentication mechanisms often require exposing user or device identity information during link setup.
- This creates privacy risks such as tracking, profiling, or data leakage.
- Additionally, centralized authentication systems can be single points of failure or surveillance.

## Solution

- Integrates a lightweight, SHA256-based zero-knowledge proof inspired challenge-response protocol at the link layer.
- This allows clients to prove their legitimacy to servers without revealing sensitive credentials or identity data.
- It preserves anonymity, reduces attack surface, and builds trust without relying on centralized authorities.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3 with Reticulum Networking Stack (RNS)
- Cryptographic hashing (SHA256) for challenge-response proof
- Open-source Reticulum API for mesh-style packet routing and link management
- argparse for CLI interface
- Modular design for easy zk-SNARK/STARK integration later

## Privacy Impact

- Minimizes data exposure by using zero-knowledge proofs during authentication
- Prevents link-layer identity leakage and tracking by hiding client secrets
- Enables decentralized, trustless verification without centralized identity stores
- Reduces risks of profiling or unauthorized device identification on 5G networks

## Real-World Use Cases

- Privacy-focused IoT device onboarding on 5G/mesh networks
- Secure and anonymous consumer 5G connections in privacy-sensitive environments
- Decentralized access control in edge computing and private 5G deployments
- Foundations for future zk-enabled telecom infrastructure

## Business Logic

- Open-source foundation to foster ecosystem contributions and auditability
- Potential for integration into commercial 5G private networks and IoT platforms
- Opportunity for premium enterprise-grade zk-authentication modules and support services
- Enables compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) as a competitive differentiator

## What's Next

- Replace mock SHA256 challenge-response with real zk-SNARK or zk-STARK proofs
- Integrate with 5G core network authentication protocols for seamless end-to-end privacy
- Develop SDKs and APIs to facilitate adoption by IoT manufacturers and telco operators
- Build demo apps showcasing anonymous device onboarding and secure messaging over 5G
- Collaborate with open-source 5G projects (e.g., Open5GS, OAI) to upstream zkLink concepts
