## Description (TL;DR)
[A private & secure whistleblower platform using zk email verification and attestation to solve critical verification gaps in anonymous reporting systems.]

## Problem
[Current private whistleblower platforms often lack robust encryption and anonymization, risking exposure of sensitive data and whistleblower identities. Centralized systems also make them vulnerable to single points of failure and targeted attacks.]

## Solution
[Utilising zk proofs for email verification we can prove source legitimacy (organisational affiliation, professional credentials) wihout revealing identity, while blockchain attestations provide tamper-proof evidence authentication and immutable audit trails. This created graduated transparency where sources selectively disclouse verification information while maintaing anonymity. ]

## Technology Stack
[noir , zkemail, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, React, VibeCoding, zkverify]

## Privacy Impact
[Eliminates single points of failure in current trust models by replacing institutional trust with ZKPs. Enables anonymous professional credibility verification and evidence authentication without metadata exposure. ZKPs can verify DKIM signatures without revelaing email content, prove domain affilliation without identity disclosure, and confirm specific email properties while keeping sensitive information private. It allows complete privacy for whistleblowes and an increased level of credibility for the interested communities that can take furhter action.]

## Real-World Use Cases
[- Corporate whistleblowers proving organisational access without identity disclosure 
 - Professional forums for verified lawyers, journalists, and experts maintaining anonymity
 - News organisations authentication anonymous source evidence with cryptographic guarantees
 - Any party of a community that would otherwise be too vulnerable to share sensitive information if identity disclosed]

## Business Logic
[While the model can be grown and marketed as a Infrastructure-as-a-Service model and partner with already established platforms. In terms of revenue it can be done through API usage, enterprise licensing, and premium verification services, however we believe a platform like this should be avaialble to the public without invoking financial entry-barriers and a Common Public Good funded by aligned communities.]
