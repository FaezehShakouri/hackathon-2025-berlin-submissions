## Description (TL;DR)
Midnight-Vote is a privacy-preserving voting platform for DAOs built on Midnight. It enables the creation of secure, anonymous polls where individual votes remain private, leveraging zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure fairness and prevent manipulation.

## Problem
DAOs need to make collective decisions, but current on-chain voting systems often expose individual votes, opening the door to voter coercion, bribery, and vote manipulation. Additionally, most voting platforms struggle to balance transparency and privacy, especially when it comes to sensitive or strategic decisions.

## Solution
Midnight-Vote uses Midnight's zero-knowledge primitives—specifically nullifier hashes and Merkle trees—to ensure that:

Each voter can vote only once (anti-sybil, anti-double-voting)

Votes remain anonymous

Results are hidden until either voting ends or a minimum quorum (e.g., 10 votes) is reached to reduce pattern detection or strategic early voting

This balances privacy, integrity, and DAO transparency, making governance more secure and trustworthy.

## Technology Stack
Midnight Protocol – for privacy-preserving execution

Merkle Trees – for managing voter inclusion without leaking identity

Nullifier Hashes – to prevent double-voting while keeping votes anonymous

TypeScript + React – for frontend voting interface

Midnight SDKs – smart contract development

IPFS / Arweave (optional) – for decentralized poll metadata storage

## Privacy Impact
Midnight-Vote improves privacy by:

Concealing individual votes and voter identities

Delaying result visibility until quorum or closure to prevent inference attacks

Using on-chain privacy primitives to allow public verifiability without sacrificing anonymity


## Real-World Use Cases
DAOs voting on sensitive financial or organizational decisions

Worker cooperatives needing anonymous governance tools

Anonymous community proposals in activist or whistleblower groups

NFT project governance without risking sybil or social pressure attacks

## Business Logic
Frictionless DAO Integration: Easy-to-use SDK/API for DAOs to plug into their existing systems

Freemium Model: Free basic poll creation, with paid features for advanced analytics, long-term storage, or higher throughput

Token-Based Voting Credits: Users pay a small fee or stake tokens to create a poll or participate, deterring spam

Partnerships with DAO tooling platforms for integration and co-marketing

## What's Next
Support for ranked-choice and quadratic voting

Mobile-first UI for global accessibility

Integration with DAO tooling platforms (e.g., Aragon, Tally)

Encrypted off-chain comments tied to poll choices for richer governance

Gas optimization for large-scale participation

Snapshot-compatible plug-in for off-chain governance mirroring
