## Description (TL;DR)
[goblow.it](https://goblow.it) empowers whistleblowers to anonymously and securely report verifiably true Telegram messages—such as evidence of misconduct, corruption, or unethical behavior—directly to the public, all while protecting their identity. Users can submit their contextual report along with a zkTLS proof of the veracity of the Telegram message and receive public or private donations from anyone that cares to support their whistleblowing efforts.

## Problem
What should you do if you receive a message on Telegram (either privately on in a group chat), that is abusive, incriminating, or indicative of criminal intent?

Show it to someone else?
Report it to the authorities?
Or just simply take a screenshot of it?

We can probably all agree that it is a very natural human behavior to take a screenshot of a weird/suspicious/incriminating conversation or message, just to have it as insurance, for the future. The issue is that a screenshot is not a good and verifiable piece evidence in this day and age, given that anyone can easily fabricate a screenshot with any content whatsoever.

Also, if you report it to the authorities, you risk them confiscating your phone and access all of your other messages in there.

If you show it to someone else, you make them unwilling witnesses to a potential crime. 

Not ideal.
